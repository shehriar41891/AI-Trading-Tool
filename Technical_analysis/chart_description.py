       and if itâ€™s trading above the 9 EMA.
    2. **Volume**: Check for low volume on red candles (pullbacks) and high volume on 
       green candles (potential buy signal).
    3. **Support & Resistance**: Consider key support and resistance levels, and suggest 
       a stop-loss level.

The candlestick chart for AAPL shows an initial uptrend in the morning, 
followed by a peak around midday before experiencing a sharp decline in the afternoon.
The price consistently stays below both the 10-period SMA and EMA after the drop, 
indicating bearish momentum. Bollinger Bands widen during the selloff, 
signaling high volatility, and later contract, suggesting reduced price movement.
The overall trend remains downward, with no strong reversal signals,
implying continued selling pressure.
