Sorry, as a text-based AI model, I don't have the capability to directly analyze or view images. However, I can help to explain the candlestick chart patterns and how they might be used for making buying or selling decisions based on your description.

1. Bullish Engulfing: This is a reversal pattern that occurs at the end of a downtrend. It is represented by a small red (bearish) candle followed by a larger green (bullish) candle that 'engulfs' the body of the previous candle. Traders usually take this as a sign to go long or buy shares as it is indicative of a potential upward movement starting.

2. Bearish Engulfing: This is the exact opposite of the bullish engulfing pattern. It is a reversal signal that usually signifies the end of an uptrend and the beginning of a downtrend. Traders often short stock when they identify this pattern.

3. Hammer / Inverted Hammer: These are bullish reversal patterns that signify a potential price bottom. The hammer has a small body with a long lower wick and no or very little upper wick, while the inverted hammer is the exact opposite. The long lower wick of a hammer indicates that sellers were in control during the period but were overcome by buyers.

4. Shooting Star / Hanging Man: These two are bearish patterns. The shooting star represents a peak or top, and the hanging man usually precedes a price fall. The long upper wick of a shooting star indicates that buyers were in control but were overtaken by sellers.

5. Doji: This is a pattern where the opening and closing prices are almost equal, resulting in a very small body. The pattern can indicate either a continuation or a reversal, depending on the context and additional confirmation.

6. Morning Star / Evening Star: These are three-candlestick patterns indicating a reversal. The morning star is a bullish reversal pattern that occurs at the end of a downtrend, while the evening star is a bearish reversal pattern at the peak of an uptrend.

By identifying and understanding these patterns, traders can make informed decisions about when to buy or sell their stocks. Always remember that candlestick patterns should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis to increase the likelihood of successful trades.
